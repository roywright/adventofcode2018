# Advent of Code 2018
## (and other 2018 puzzles)

From time to time throughout 2018, I've come across puzzles that I thought would be interesting to solve via programming. My explorations of some of these puzzles can be found here, in `puzzles.ipynb`.

Of course, the main contents of this repository are my solutions to [this year's Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/2018), in the file `advent.ipynb`. Elegance and explanatory comments are minimal, as I write my solutions as fast as possible in the spirit of competition. But unfortunately, I will not always have a chance to sit down and start a puzzle right on time.
