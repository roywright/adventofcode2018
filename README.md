Elegance and explanatory comments are minimal, as I write my code as fast as possible, in the spirit of competition. But I will often not have a chance to sit down and start a puzzle for a while &mdash; maybe even the next day.

Also in this repository are solutions to some other interesting puzzles I saw online earlier in 2018.
